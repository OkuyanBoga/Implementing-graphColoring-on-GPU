# Implementing-graphColoring-on-GPU

The purpose is to implement the CJP algorithm on the GPU. This algorithm has been proposed in the paper, "Efficient Algorithms for Graph Coloring on GPU", by Quang Anh Pham Nguyen and Rui Fan.

NOTE: The paper is available in the repository. 

The implementation is specific for NVIDIA GPUs because we use CUDA.
